# SPIS-final-project

Our project is a machine learning project on comparing different algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The data set we are using consists of the amount of money transacted, the time between transactions and 28 other variables that are not disclosed for privacy reasons. Our minimum viable product consists of following a video tutorial which walks through code that uses two different anomaly detecting algorithms, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, to detect credit card fraud from the given dataset. We have finished the tutorial and analyzed the results of these two models and found that their accuracy levels are low. Our next step is to implement the Logistic Regression and Elliptic Envelope algorithms on the dataset and compare them to the previous algorithms to see whether these models give more accurate results. We are running into challenges in understanding how these two algorithms work in order to implement them.
